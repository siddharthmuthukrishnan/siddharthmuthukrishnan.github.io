  <section id="About">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm a PhD candidate at Pitt HPS. I primarily work in philosophy of physics, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, and philosophy of computer science. I'm also interested in early modern philosophy (especially Newton and Descartes), biomedical ethics, and metaethics. Earlier, I did a PhD in quantum computing theory, and I continue to find that field fascinating.</p>
