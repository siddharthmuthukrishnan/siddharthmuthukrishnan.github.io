  <section id="About">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Starting in September 2025 I will be a postdoctoral scholar at the Black Hole Initiative at Harvard University. Presently, I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Pitt HPS and I finished up my PhD at the same department (both are supervised by David Wallace). I primarily work in philosophy of physics, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, and philosophy of computer science. I'm also interested in early modern philosophy (especially Newton and Descartes), biomedical ethics, and metaethics. Earlier, I did a PhD in quantum computing theory, and I continue to find that field fascinating.</p>
